# GrubDash
## A Thinkful Project

This project focuses on the build of a RESTful API that manages data for multiple resources and routes.

The GrubDash application allows users to place food orders online. It contains custom middleware functions, single-responsibility handler functions, and chained ```route()``` methods. 

It is written using Javascript. The frontend is built with HTML and CSS but did not need to be connected for the successful completion of this project. At a later date, after I've completed this program, I will come back and attempt to attach them together for a full-blown front-to-back end web application. Stay tuned!
